					<h2><a href="img/projects/conservesfwater/waterconservation_process.pdf" target="_blank">View the Process Book</a></h2>
					<p>This project was done in a group of six, each person having a different role. My role was the art director, leaving me in charge of the group alongside the project manager. The goal was to create a website based on a topic of our choosing. Water conservation is a major concern in today's world, so we figured we would give that a try.</p>
					<p>The idea was to make a tip website for anyone looking for ideas on how to conserve water around the house, more specifically in the San Francisco area. We started out with ideation, moving on to rough sketching and wireframes. When the concept was clear, I was able to start my process of taking on the design of a logo.</p>
					<p>A lot has been done with water already logo-wise, so I wanted to attempt to create something new. I had to broaden my target audience to the whole world in order to accomplish that.</p>
					<p>My final design is successful in that it captures the idea of both conservation and growth. Conservation through the brown, earth-like object encapsulating the water droplet, and growth through the rising vine into new, budding leaves achieved my design goals.</p>

Once the gender is selected, the proper form will appear as well as the 'nude' character. When different elements are selected, the character's appearance will change. On submit, the JavaScript will perform a function to check whether or not a specified field has been filled out. If one is not filled out, an error message will appear.

					<p>Corporate identity piece for Narnaut Marine, a fititious nautical supply company based in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
					<p>The project required the conception and design of a logo, as well as stationery design, and a design manual to make sure the logo will be used correctly.</p>
					<p>The name originated from the word 'narwhal' since the mysterious sea creature is one of my favorite nautical mammals. Though the name is derived from a specific animal, that did not need to be mirrored in the logo itself. Boating is what first thing that comes to mind when the word nautical is thrown at me.</p>
					<p>In an attempt to make company have a more adventurous feel, I decided to play with the form of a paper boat (often made by children on the banks of a flowing river to get a sense of adventure and imagination). Paired with this form, a select few blue-toned colors were used in order to enhance the feeling of water.</p>

					<p>Meredith Marshal is a fictitious client made up in order to create a client-based web project. This project was taken on by myself and two other people. I wore many hats in the process of this website, which were project manager, designer, and developer.</p>
					<p>The first step in the process was to understand exactly how we wanted to sell our client and what they would want out of the website. Meredith Marshal, our fictitious client is a fitness and nutrition coach through beachbody.com. She really focuses on nutrition, and believes it to be her strongest skill in terms of fitness.</p>
					<p>With this information, as a group, we created wireframes and made sure everything was included. Body copy was created to fit into each page. After we had a good idea of what the site would look like, hi-fidelity mockups were made with the help of stock imagery. A color scheme was chosen, green being the primary color to help emphasize the idea of nutrition.</p>
					<p>My role as the developer comes in at this point. I make a prototype on the web using HTML and CSS so that we have an idea of how everything will lay out on the screen. A group decision is made to transfer this to Wordpress for ease of use for any clients that the site may be sold to.</p>
					<p>At this point a logo needs to be made. I wanted to make use of both type and icon. Nutrition has a strong emphasis on eating your greens and a leaf is a great representation for that. The next step was to find a way to combine the leaf and the letter 'M.'</p>

					<p>Sparked from a visit to a job club type meetup at the LGBT Community Center in San Francisco, this idea was a stepping stone into a greater interest in the gay rights movement.</p>
					<p>In the meetup, I noticed that there was some sort of concern in the job hunting process while being openly gay. I wanted to make some sort of solution for that.</p>
					<p>This project has gone through two iterations, the first a year ago as a project for a basic web class, and the second starting in 2015 for a senior project class. I wanted to tackle this project with all of the new skills I had learned, making it actually functional with a database and search features.</p>
